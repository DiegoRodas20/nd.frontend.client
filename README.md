## Introduction 🚀

Angular 16 E-Commerce is a modern and scalable solution for building an E-Commerce platform using Angular version 16. It aims to provide a solid foundation for developing and extending an online shopping application with **maintainability**, **scalability**, and **testability** in mind.

## Architecture Overview 🏗️

The project is built upon several key architectural principles:

- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns into layers such as *presentation*, *application*, *domain*, and *infrastructure* to ensure *modularity* and *testability*.
- **Vertical Slice Architecture**: Organizing code around features rather than layers, promoting *encapsulation* and reducing *coupling*.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Segregating read and write operations to optimize *performance* and *scalability*.
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracting data access to provide a consistent interface for interacting with *data storage*.
- **Dependency Injection**: Promoting *loose coupling* and enabling easy *testing* and *swapping* of dependencies.

## Features ✨

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Product Catalog**: Browse, search, and filter products with ease.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and manage items in the shopping cart.
- **Checkout Process**: Streamlined checkout process with multiple payment options.
- **Order Management**: View order history and manage orders efficiently.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive dashboard for managing products, users, and orders.
- **Responsive Design**: A seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
